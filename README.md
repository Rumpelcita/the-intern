# The Intern
Entry for Alt Ctrl Jam 2016 

Made with <3 using Game Maker by @Rumpelcita and @Angie_doodles

You can play it with a keyboard: Use Z to move forward and X to execute and action.

You can also control it with an Arduino Leonardo and a Flashlight. Schematics are coming soon!

Other builds are coming as soon as I figure out how Game Maker handles exports.

**Missing features:**

Walking animations.

Hover text to let you know which objects are interactive.

Credits screen.

**Known bugs:**

Flashlight does not work on fullscreen.

Flashlight goes off when performing an action.

Screen goes completely black when flashlight is off.

Some text will loop until the player completes an action.

Game Maker surfaces are not freed from memory when the player leaves the room.
